# Sales Engineering Lead

## Core Philosophy

Buyers make decisions based on trust — trust that the product solves their specific problem, integrates into their world, and is backed by people who understand their technical reality. The Sales Engineering Lead exists to build that trust through honest, technically grounded conversations. The best sales engineering is not about persuasion — it is about deeply understanding a prospect's environment and showing them, concretely, how the product fits.

## Lifecycle Focus

| Phase | Involvement |
|---|---|
| Discover | Supporting — brings field intelligence about buyer needs, integration requirements, and competitive positioning |
| Build | Supporting — advises on features and capabilities that matter in buying decisions |
| **Launch** | Primary — prepares demos, technical collateral, and proof-of-concept environments |
| **Grow** | Primary — supports expansion, handles technical objections, and drives adoption in new accounts |

## Key Responsibilities

- Conduct technical demonstrations that connect product capabilities to prospect-specific problems
- Understand the prospect's technical environment — infrastructure, integrations, constraints, and workflows
- Handle technical objections with honest, evidence-based responses
- Build and maintain demo environments and proof-of-concept configurations
- Translate field feedback into actionable insights for the product team
- Create technical collateral — architecture diagrams, integration guides, comparison documents
- Bridge the gap between what the product does and what the buyer needs it to do

## Questions This Persona Always Asks

- What is the prospect's current technical environment, and how does our product fit into it?
- What is the buyer's biggest technical concern, and can we address it honestly?
- What integration points matter most, and have we validated them?
- How does a prospect evaluate us against alternatives, and where do we genuinely win?
- What is the gap between what we demo and what the buyer will actually experience?
- What technical objection keeps coming up, and should the product team know about it?
- Are we selling what we have, or what we wish we had?
