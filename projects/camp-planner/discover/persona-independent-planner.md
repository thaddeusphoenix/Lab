# User Persona: The Independent Planner

**Project:** Camp Planner
**Created:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** Hypothetical — based on problem framing and gaps identified in Sari Gelzer research session

## Who They Are

A working parent — typically in a two-parent household — with one school-age child between the ages of 6 and 11. They manage summer planning alone; their spouse is either uninvolved or defers entirely. They don't have a deep parent network to draw on for recommendations, and they don't lean on one. They research programs independently, make deliberate decisions, and commit. They are not overbookers — they register for two or three programs, decide, and consider the summer done.

**Representative name:** Jamie
**Household:** Two working parents, one child (age 9)
**Planning style:** Deliberate and contained. Does the research once, makes a decision, doesn't revisit it.

## How They Work

Jamie starts thinking about summer in March, later than Morgan. The search is methodical: look at last year's programs, check a few new options, read reviews if they exist, pick the best fit. Jamie does not register for programs speculatively. Once registered, the plan is settled — there is no active management of a "considering" list, no cancellation window juggling.

The system Jamie uses is minimal: a few calendar events for deadlines, maybe a note with program names and dates. It works well enough when there are only two or three programs to track. Where it breaks down is when life gets busy and the calendar events don't carry enough context — "Camp deadline" means nothing three weeks after it was set.

## What They Need

- **Low-overhead tracking.** Jamie is managing a small number of programs. A tool optimized for twelve programs and overbooking management will feel like too much. Complexity is friction.
- **Deadline reminders with context.** The calendar event problem: reminders fire but carry no detail about what program, what fee, what link. Jamie needs the reminder and the information together.
- **A simple coverage check.** Not a sophisticated week-by-week analysis — just confidence that the important weeks are covered. One visual pass should be enough.
- **Quick data entry.** If adding a program takes more than two minutes, Jamie will skip it and stay with the calendar.

## What Success Looks Like

Three programs logged, dates and deadlines visible, reminders set. No spreadsheet. No calendar archaeology when a deadline fires. Summer confirmed by late March with minimal ongoing attention required.

## Current Workarounds and Their Failure Modes

| Workaround | What works | Where it breaks |
|---|---|---|
| Calendar events for deadlines | Reminders fire | No program context attached — "deadline for what?" |
| Notes app for program details | Easy to add | Not connected to calendar; requires manual cross-referencing |
| Memory | Fast for a small number of programs | Fails under load or when deadlines are far out |

## Open Research Questions

1. **Is Jamie an independent planner by preference or circumstance?** Do they wish they had a parent network and don't, or have they chosen not to rely on one? The answer affects whether social features feel irrelevant or actively unwelcome.
2. **Does a two- or three-program user still feel deadline anxiety?** Or does the smaller scale make the problem manageable enough that no tool is actually needed? This persona only matters if the pain is real at small scale.
3. **Does Jamie overbook once they've had a bad experience?** Behavior may evolve. A first-year camp parent may look like Jamie; by year three they may look more like Morgan. Understanding where Jamie is in that arc matters for retention.
4. **How does Jamie respond to features built for Morgan?** In prototype reviews, watch for signs of cognitive overload — too many statuses, too much emphasis on overbooking, too many decisions surfaced at once. If Jamie feels like the product isn't for them, that's signal about scope and information density.
