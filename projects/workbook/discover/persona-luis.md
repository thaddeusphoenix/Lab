# User Persona: Luis — The Mobile Laborer

> Base-level tradesperson. Works for whoever is hiring — different crews, different GCs, different projects. Follows the work.

## Who He Is

Luis is in his late 20s and has been in construction for five years. He is not self-employed — he works for GCs, framing crews, demo teams, and whoever else needs a body on a site. He is not specialized in a single trade. He can do framing, rough demo, concrete work, moving materials, site cleanup, and basic labor on any type of job. He is reliable and experienced enough that foremen call him back, but he does not have a stable employer. He goes where the work is.

In a given month he might work two weeks for one framing crew, a week for a different GC doing site prep, and spend the last week looking for the next thing. He finds work through other workers — a friend texts him saying a crew needs someone Monday, a foreman he worked for six months ago calls with a three-week job.

## How He Works

Luis shows up where he is told to show up. He does not set scope or quote prices — he agrees on a day rate with the foreman or GC who hired him and works until the job ends or the work dries up. He may work for four people in a single month and none of them know about the others.

He does not have a contract. The agreement is verbal: "We're paying $180 a day, cash on Fridays" or "It's a two-week job, we'll square up at the end." That is the entire basis for what he will be paid.

## How Payment Currently Works

Payment is the most unpredictable part of Luis's work life. Some foremen are reliable — they pay exactly what was agreed, on the day they said. Others are not. Common problems:

- End-of-week payment delayed without explanation
- Promised rate quietly revised down when it comes time to pay ("we can do $150 today")
- Hours disputed — the foreman says Luis worked three days, Luis knows it was four
- GC runs short on cash and tells workers to wait until the next draw comes in
- A job ends abruptly and the foreman is suddenly unreachable

Luis has no leverage in these situations. There is no written agreement. He was not given anything in writing when he started. His only option is to refuse to come back — but by then, the money is already owed and may already be lost.

## Technology

Uses WhatsApp as much as Marco does, but primarily for communication — group chats with crews, messages from foremen, coordinating logistics. Comfortable with text. Not oriented toward any kind of business software or professional tool. Does not think of himself as running a business.

## What He Needs

A quick way to confirm his rate and terms in writing when he starts with a new foreman or GC — before the first day of work, not after. And a way to send a simple tally at the end of a week or job: "I worked four days at $180, you owe me $720." Something he can point to if the number gets disputed. Not a formal contract — just a written record that both parties have seen and agreed to.

## His Relationship With Workbook

The flow for Luis is different from Marco's. He is not invoicing homeowners for completed projects — he is confirming day rates with employers and tracking hours across multiple active engagements. When he starts with a new crew, he texts Workbook to generate a rate agreement: "Starting Monday with Ramos framing, $185/day." Workbook generates a confirmation text he can forward to the foreman. At the end of the week, he texts "I worked 4 days for Ramos" and gets a tally to send. He can ask "what do I have outstanding?" and get a summary across all current employers.

His ledger looks different from Marco's — it is organized by employer, not by project, and tracks days and rates rather than flat project fees.

## What Success Looks Like For Him

A written record that exists before the dispute, not after. The ability to say "you confirmed $185 a day on Monday" and show it in a thread. Fewer weeks where he is short on rent because a foreman paid him less than what was agreed and he had nothing to push back with.
