# User Persona: Marco — The Independent Worker

> Self-employed handyman and tile specialist. Runs his own operation, finds his own clients, handles everything himself.

---

## Who He Is

Marco is in his mid-30s and has been doing tile and general handyman work for about eight years. He is not registered as a business — he works under his own name, gets paid to his personal account or in cash, and handles his own taxes. He has a small but reliable set of repeat clients — a landlord who calls him whenever a unit turns over, a few homeowners who found him through a neighbor. New clients come from referrals. He has never needed a website or an ad.

He works alone. Occasionally he pulls in a helper for a bigger job, but he is the person his clients call, the person who shows up, and the person responsible for the outcome.

## How He Works

A typical job: a homeowner contacts him about retiling a bathroom. He visits, looks at the job, and gives a price — usually verbally, sometimes via text. He quotes a flat rate for the project, not hourly. They agree, he starts on the agreed date, and he finishes when the work is done. He buys his own materials, which he factors into the quote.

He may be running two or three jobs at the same time — different clients, different stages. He tracks this in his head and in a loose string of WhatsApp threads.

## How Payment Currently Works

After the job is done, Marco texts the client something like "all finished, it came to $950." Sometimes they pay that day. Often they say they'll send it "later in the week." Sometimes he has to follow up two or three times. Occasionally a client goes quiet and he has to decide whether to push harder or write it off.

The scope problem is just as common as the payment problem. A client who agreed to "retile the bathroom floor" will ask him to also replace the grout around the tub, paint the walls, fix the vanity — always framed as small additions, always after the job has started. Because nothing was written down, Marco has no clean way to say no without damaging the relationship. He usually just does it and absorbs the cost.

## Technology

Uses WhatsApp constantly — it is how he communicates with clients, helpers, and suppliers. Comfortable with basic smartphone use. Does not use any business software. Has tried to use a notes app to track jobs but never maintained it. Does not have a bank business account.

## What He Needs

A professional, fast way to confirm scope before a job starts and send a real invoice when it ends. Not a business suite — just the two moments that matter. The agreement protects him from scope creep. The invoice changes the dynamic from "asking a favor" to "requesting payment for a service rendered."

## His Relationship With Workbook

Workbook is a tool he reaches for at the start and end of every job. He texts it to generate a scope agreement, forwards that to the client, and gets a YES back before he starts. When the job is done, he texts it again to get an invoice, sends it, and marks the job paid when money arrives. Between those moments, it is invisible — he is not logging into anything or maintaining a profile. He has a simple list of what is active, invoiced, and paid.

## What Success Looks Like For Him

Fewer conversations where he is chasing payment. A written record he can point to if a client disputes what was agreed. The ability to say "I sent you the invoice last week" rather than "I thought you were going to pay me."
