# Daily Summary — Tiny Tracks — 2026-02-25

## Status

First prototype test completed. Participant was outside the target user profile (age 8, not an adult hobbyist), which was the risk Neuromancer flagged yesterday. The observation is real and worth analyzing, but cannot drive product direction on its own. The immediate priority is getting the right participant in front of the prototype.

---

## What Moved Forward

- First human interaction with the prototype completed — unstructured, but a real session
- Research observation filed: `reports/2026-02-25-research-observation-01.md`
- Participant profile problem confirmed: testing happened before a profile was defined

---

## What Is Blocked

**Target-profile validation is still zero.** We have one session with one participant who does not match the target user. The building experience validation brief's primary question — is building from scratch engaging to the target user? — remains unanswered. We need a session with an adult who fits the "drawn to model railroading" profile before we can act on the brief's hypotheses.

## Decisions Needed From PM

1. **Is there a child or family segment worth designing for alongside the adult hobbyist?** The 8-year-old's response was genuine. It either means we have an untapped secondary audience, or it confirms our positioning by showing where we are *not* pointing the product. That's a strategic call only the PM can make.

2. **Define the participant profile for the next session, today.** Yesterday this was a recommendation. Today it is urgent. We ran a session without one and got data we can't cleanly act on. The next session needs a defined participant before it happens.

3. **Does the "creative possibility" question get added to the observation guide?** The child's feedback may be pointing at something that applies to adult users too — that the building palette feels creatively limited. This should be an explicit observation target in the next session, not an afterthought.

## Signals Worth Watching

- **The fantastical requests (teleport, crazy loops) may translate to elevation for adult users.** A child's "crazy loop" is, in model train terms, a helix or spiral ramp. Elevation is on the long-term roadmap. If adult users reach for it quickly, it may need to move earlier.

- **The realism positioning may be self-selecting.** An 8-year-old wanted fantasy. An adult hobbyist may want exactly what we are building. The contrast might be the clearest evidence yet that the positioning is right — and that the product is not for everyone, which is fine.

- **No session structure means no clean findings.** We observed something, but we don't know: how long the participant spent, what they tried first, whether they successfully placed a piece of track, or whether they ran the train. Unstructured sessions produce impressions, not evidence. The observation guide needs to exist before the next session.

---

## PO Suggestions

1. **Don't course-correct yet.** One data point from one out-of-profile participant is not a reason to revisit the realism direction. File it, note what it might be pointing at, and validate with the right user before acting.

2. **Use this session to motivate the observation guide, not to answer the brief's questions.** The child's reaction gives Neuromancer something concrete to design against. Ask: what *would* we have wanted to know from this session that we couldn't capture? Build the guide around those gaps.

3. **Consider running the next session with a lapsed model railroader specifically.** Of the three candidate profiles — hobby-curious adult, lapsed railroader, parent with a kid — the lapsed railroader is most likely to have the intrinsic motivation the brief assumes. They've felt the satisfaction of the hobby before and stopped due to cost or space. If anyone is primed to feel the building loop as rewarding, it is them.

## Process & Automation Opportunities

| Opportunity | Category | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| No session structure for the first test — findings are impressionistic | Artifact | Confirms yesterday's flag. Observation guide is now urgent, not just recommended. |
| No participant screening criteria existed before the session | Artifact | Neuromancer needs a one-page participant brief: who we're looking for, what disqualifies a candidate, what we tell them the session is. |
| Research findings have no standard home in the project structure — this report and the observation note are in `reports/` by convention, but that's ad hoc | Process support | Consider formalizing `reports/` as the research log location in the project README so the team knows where to look. |
