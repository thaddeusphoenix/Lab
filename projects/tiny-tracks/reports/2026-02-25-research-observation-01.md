## What Was Observed

During initial testing of the Cardboard prototype, the participant expressed a desire for fantastical gameplay elements — specifically: a teleport tunnel and "crazy loops."

## Immediate Flags

### 1. Participant is outside the target user profile

The building experience validation brief describes the target user as "someone drawn to the idea of building a miniature train layout." The strategic brief frames the product as simulating the *craft* of model railroading — the decisions and satisfaction of assembling a miniature landscape.

An 8-year-old boy is a different user segment. His mental model for a train simulation is almost certainly shaped by toy trains and play-oriented media, not the adult hobbyist experience the product is designed around. His feedback is real and worth examining — but it cannot be generalized to the target user without more evidence.

**This confirms Neuromancer's warning from 2026-02-24:** the participant profile was not defined before testing began. The result is a genuine observation from a genuine user that may or may not be relevant to the product we are building.

### 2. This is one data point from one session

Do not change direction on this alone. Identify what the observation is pointing at, then validate with additional participants who fit the target profile.

## What the Signal Might Actually Mean

The fantastical requests (teleport tunnel, crazy loops) are the 8-year-old's vocabulary. Underneath them may be a real signal that applies across age groups:

**The current building palette may not produce enough creative possibility or surprise.** A flat 16×16 grid with straight track, four curve orientations, and crossings is a limited creative space. An adult hobbyist may feel the same creative constraint the child expressed as "I want a teleport" — just described differently: "I ran out of interesting things to build."

This is worth testing directly with target-profile users. The question to ask: *does the building experience feel creatively constrained, or creatively open?*

**Crazy loops may also be pointing at elevation.** A child's "crazy loop" is, in physical model train terms, a helix or a spiral ramp — elevated track that changes height. Elevation is on the product's future roadmap ("elevated terrain, tunnels, bridges") and was deliberately deferred. If adult users also reach for it quickly, it may need to move earlier.

## What This Does Not Mean

- It does not mean the product should add teleport mechanics or cartoon-physics elements. The explicit positioning decision was to differentiate from the "cartoon version" of model train building. That decision stands unless the PM reverses it with evidence from target-profile users.
- It does not invalidate the realism direction. It may actually reinforce it — an 8-year-old wants fantasy because the realism isn't *his* product. That's not a problem; it's a positioning confirmation.

## Routed to Wintermute — Questions That Need Answers

1. **Is there a family/child segment worth considering alongside the adult hobbyist?** The product could serve both with different entry points, or it could stay focused. This is a strategic question, not a feature question.

2. **Does "creative possibility" feel limited to our target users too?** The child's feedback suggests the building palette may feel constraining. We don't know if adult users feel the same. This should be a specific observation target in the next session with a target-profile participant.

3. **How do we handle the elevation question?** If adult users also reach for "going up" quickly, elevation may need to move from "future direction" to "next milestone."
